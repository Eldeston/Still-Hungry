    **Still Hungry** is a datapack that aims to add harder mobs, random events, and increased difficulty to vanilla minecraft along with more powerful tools and weapons against the hard difficulty.

    This is inspired by Terraria's hardmode and the achievement "Still Hungry" after defeating the Wall of Flesh, a guardian that seals the anciant spirits of dark and light and entering a new phase called hardmode.
